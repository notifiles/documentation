        A dedicated system entry in every feature allows for a custom docker-compose based infrastructure needed by the feature. The Notifiles server will automatically assign free ports and run docker containers if a feature needs them.

        Beyond the core server component, a feature can have an accompanying frontend library that provides UI components and logic. For example the followable feature offers a React extension that displays a state managed <i>Follow</i> button.
