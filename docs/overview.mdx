We use the [Di√°taxis documentation authoring framework](https://diataxis.fr) which organizes technical documentation into a system based on four quadrants:

- Learning-oriented Tutorials provide hands-on lessons where users can learn the framework by doing.

- Problem-oriented How-to Guides provide recipes to solve specific goals you may encounter while building a LoopBack project.

- Understanding-oriented Concepts pages provide the explanation of architecture concepts, wider view and deeper knowledge about the framework.

- Information-oriented Reference guides provide technical description of the machinery and how to use it.
